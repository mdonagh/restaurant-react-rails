# restaurant-react-rails

This is a take-home coding assessment I did recently with a React Client and a Rails Back-end. 

I thought this project was particularly interesting because it uses a standalone React client and the devise_token_auth gem https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth which allows client-agnostic authentication against a Rails API application, while also allowing access to all of the functionality of the Devise gem.

UI uses react-bootstrap.
